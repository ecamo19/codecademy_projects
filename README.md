This repository you can found the function for performing two tasks:

+ Count the total number of colors in a image. This is done with the function called count_colors.py

+ Reduce the number of colors in a image (aka Image quantization). This functions uses the K-Means algorithm, and uses the function called color_reduction_k_means.py

+ The folder called test_images contains three images that can be use to show how the functions work.

For running the program, press the binder bottom and open the Jupyter Notebook called count_and_reduce_program.ipynb
