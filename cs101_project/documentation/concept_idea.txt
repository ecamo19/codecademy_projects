Think of an Idea ---------------------------------------------------------------

Take some time to think of an idea for your project. ðŸ’¡

Some questions you can ask yourself is:

+ Who do you want to build something for? Yourself? Your friends? Your family?
Your co-workers?

R/ Myself

What are your/their hobbies?

R/ My hobbie is Data science

+ Do you want to build something more fun or something more useful?

R/ Build something for fun


Idea: 

1) Use Rstudio âœ…

2) Set up an RStudio project âœ…

3) Set a virtual environment in RStudio using pipenv, see Mauro's email on how 
to set an enviroment. 

4) Load an image using input(). In this case, the user will specify the path where
the image is stored and immediately will be showed in the terminal. The user 
will be able to load one or several images. âœ…  

4.1) How to include an external dependency in a pipenv pipfile? In this case if the
user does not have magick to open the image how to include this external depependecy
in the pipenv? No idea how to do itðŸ¤· 

5) Count the colours in a image. How many colors does an image has? âœ…

6) Run k-means algorithm to reduce the number of colors in the image.

6.1) Return the new image with the new number of colors. 

8) Add functinality to return image in black and black and white if the users 
wants it.

9) The program should look like the Example Project in the overview page of
codecademy. Search how to do this.

10) Add evevething to a docker image
