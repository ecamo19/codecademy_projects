This repository you can found the function for performing two tasks: 

+ Count the total number of colors in a image. This is done by the function called count_colors.py
+ Reduce the number of colors in a image (aka Image quantization) using the K-Means algorithm. This is done by the function called color_reduction_k_means.py

The folder called test_images contains three images that can be run to show how the functions work.

For running the functions open the Jupyter Notebook called main_code.ipynb.
