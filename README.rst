This repository contains the functions for performing two tasks: 

+ Count the colors that a image has. This is done by the function called count_colors.py
+ Reduce the number of colors in a image (aka Image quantization). This is done by the function called k-means.py

The folder called test_images contains three images that can be run to show how the functions work.

For running the functions open the Jupyter Notebook called main_code.ipynb
